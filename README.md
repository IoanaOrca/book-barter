## **It's a** brain training game. Learn new words and expand your vocabulary.

**Game play:** The user can tap the matching word to keep the baloon floating.

**Features:** The user wins 400 points if guessing the synonym in under 5 seconds and pumps the air baloon up.

**Chalenges:**

- media queries
- structure canvas on top of html
- bulding the game logic

**Lessons learned:**

- how to debug | no console.log
- dealing with time intervals

If I were to start from scratch I would spend more time building game architecture.

**I would really like to improove:**

- design and CSS
- add sounds and animations
