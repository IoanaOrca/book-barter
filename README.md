# BookBarter

### Made by Jordi Calzada & Ioana Orca @Ironhack


## **It's a** full stack app where you can swap bookand connect with people with the same interests.

**User can:** 
- Search books that other people have to share,
- SignUp and Login to the platform,
- Reserve the book of their dreams,
- Add a book to the sharing community.

**Features:** 
- Location of the book on Google maps

**Chalenges:**

- Filter without refreshing the page
- Finding the personal strong points and building on top
- Working with databases and api

**Lessons learned:**

- Git and Github flow
- Team workflow and sharing knowledge
- Architecture of a full stack app

If we were to start from scratch I would spend more time building game architecture.

**We would really like to improove:**

- Filter search by proximity
- Add a leave reviews option
- Create a chat between users
